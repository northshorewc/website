# Additional Lead Information  

Lead is not found in NSWC's source water, Lake Michigan, and it is not found in water as it leaves the drinking water treatment plant.  

Years ago, lead was used in paint, plumbing, and other products. The most common source of lead is from paint in older homes built before 1978. Lead can cause health problems if it enters your body. Children under the age of six, and women who may become pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding are at special risk.  

While lead is not found in NSWC's treated water, lead may dissolve from lead service lines and plumbing fixtures owned by our customers, especially when water stands unused for several hours. To control lead dissolving into the water, the NSWC treats the water with a compound that forms a protective coating inside pipes.  

## Does your property have a lead service line?  

Structures built before 1951 may have lead service lines. The service line connects the water main in the street to the property. You water utility owns the section of the service line from the water main to the curb stop at the property line. The property owner owns the section of the service line from the curb stop to the water meter.  
    
Lead pipes are dull gray in color and are soft enough to be easily scratched with a house key, and a magnet will not stick to a lead pipe. The amount of lead that dissolves into the water will vary based on the plumbing in the building, how much water is used, and how often it is used.  

Your water utility may know if you have a lead service, or can help you determine if you have a lead service. [Please contact them for more information.](index.md#water-utilities)  

## Do this if you have a lead service line   

Flush your plumbing. Before using tap water for drinking or cooking, run the cold water until it is noticeably colder (in most cases this will take approximately 3 minutes). Do this if the water has been standing unused in your pipes for more than six hours, such as overnight. Tap water can safely be used for activities such as bathing, washing hands, washing dishes, laundry, etc. These activities help flush the pipes.

Drink and cook only with water from the **cold water** tap. Never drink or cook with water from the hot water tap. Hot water dissolves lead from pipes. Boiling the water does not remove lead. 

Regularly remove the screen and aerator from faucets, rinse out any particles, and re-attach. Do this once a month, or more frequently if there is water utility work nearby. The particles may contain lead and collect at the faucet.

### Other steps to consider: 

* Purchase a filtration system. Drinking water filtration systems or pour-through filters can reduce or eliminate lead. Look for products certified by NSF/ANSI under Standard 53 for removal of lead and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for installing and maintaining the filter.  
* Replace your lead service line or interior plumbing.  A licensed plumber can provide an estimate.   
* Have your water tested. Contact the [North Shore Health Department](http://www.nshealthdept.org) at (414) 371-2980 for more information.  

After any water utility work or internal plumbing work, it is important that you flush your plumbing. Physical disturbance of the lead service line or lead plumbing by activities such as water main replacement, service line leaks, building plumbing repair, water meter replacement or main breaks may release lead into the water.

### Here’s how to flush your plumbing after work is completed:  

1. Remove screens and aerators from the end of all faucets and rinse particles from them.  
2. Starting in the lowest level (basement) and working to the top floor, turn on the cold water.  
3. After the water runs for 5-10 minutes, start at the top floor and turn off the water, finishing in the basement. Re-attach the screens and aerators to the faucets.
